# Software to make registration of employees on the payroll made in C#

* This is a simple software to make registration of employees on the payroll, which means that is not supposed to be performatic or safe, only a practice project.
* How to run?
  * Clone the project from this GitHub repository, make sure you have VisualStudio installed or any other IDE that runs C#.
  *  Open the project in the VisualStudio environment, and run it :)
* The code is not in english because this was a college exercise.
